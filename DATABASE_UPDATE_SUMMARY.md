# Database Schema Update Summary - Professional Email Communication

## Overview
This update modifies the database schema to separate the Name column into first_name and last_name columns for more professional email communication. The system now uses only first names in email greetings for a more personal touch.

## Database Changes Required

### Tables Updated:
1. **broadmead.candidates** - Add first_name, last_name columns
2. **broadmead_v3._candidates** - Add first_name, last_name columns  
3. **broadmead.clients** - Add first_name, last_name columns
4. **broadmead_v3._clients** - Add first_name, last_name columns

### SQL Scripts Created:
- `database_update_candidates.sql` - Updates candidate tables
- `database_update_clients.sql` - Updates client tables

## Code Changes Made

### 1. src/candidates/index.php
**Updated SQL Queries:**
- Added first_name/last_name fields with fallback to Name column
- Uses `COALESCE(first_name, SUBSTRING_INDEX(Name, ' ', 1))` for first name extraction
- Email addressing now uses full_name for display, first_name for personalization

**Email Changes:**
- Personalized messages now use `$candidate->first_name` instead of full name
- Email recipient field uses `$candidate->full_name` for proper display
- Google Drive email footer implemented

### 2. src/clients/index.php  
**Updated SQL Queries:**
- Added first_name/last_name fields with fallback to Name column
- Export functionality includes new name fields
- Email personalization uses first_name only

**Email Changes:**
- Client emails now address recipients by first name only
- Email recipient field uses full_name for proper display
- Google Drive email footer implemented

### 3. mailshot_functionality.php
**Updated SQL Queries:**
- Both database queries updated to include first_name/last_name fields
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing Name column

**Email Changes:**
- Mass emails now use first_name for personalization
- Fallback to 'Candidate' if no first name available

## Email Footer Implementation
All pages now include professional email footer with:
- Company logo (Nocturnal Recruitment)
- Contact information with clickable links
- Social media badges (LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram)
- Certification badges (Cyber Essentials, REC Corporate Member)
- Google Drive hosted images for reliable email display
- Professional disclaimer

## Backward Compatibility
- All queries include fallback to existing Name column
- System works with both old and new database structures
- No data loss during transition
- Gradual migration possible

## Professional Email Benefits
1. **Personal Touch**: Uses first names only (e.g., "Hi John" instead of "Hi John Smith")
2. **Consistent Branding**: Professional email footer with all company credentials
3. **Better Deliverability**: Google Drive hosted images work reliably in emails
4. **Compliance**: Professional disclaimer and contact information included
